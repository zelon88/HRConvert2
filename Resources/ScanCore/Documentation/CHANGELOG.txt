  -Add -defsfile & -df argument for specifying a definition file by command line. 
  -Now ScanCore is completely modular. It can be run against any defs file and any config file, so automating tasks is easy & granular.
  -Add config file last modified, which core file, and which defs file to version output.
  -Add new commands to help output.
  -Will update the docs with proper error descriptions and instructions once the error numbers stop chaning.

COMMIT 3/26/2024
v1.2 - Add several def update methods, so even with no deps they work.

-v1.2.

  -Use globals $EOL, $SEP for PHP_EOL and DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, as intended.

    -Info like the source for def & app updates, the original repo, subscribed defs, version, last update, ect...

    -Support your favorite developer by buying a trophy license for your favorite open-source software.
    -Imrove comments / formatting in ScanCore_Config.php. Add default values, labels, better descriptions for everything.
    -Add -help, -h and -version, -ver arguments for showing version & help, respectively.
    -Add -configfile, -cf argument for selecting which configuration file to use.
      -Now one scanner can rule them all!
      -Instead of installing multiple scanners to scan different subscriptions, just have different config files.
    -Revise output. Make more consistent, easier to read.
    -Remove unused $LogFile and $LogDir references from core.
    -Remove unused $LogFile and $LogDir references from config.
    -ReportsDir is now the only location for logs. Logs & reports are officially the same thing.
    -The -logfile & -lf arguments are now undocumented aliases of the -reportfile and -rf arguments.
    -I plan on removing -logfile & -lf arguments in the future.
    -What will probably happen is I'll forget I said that and wind up re-documenting these undocumented aliases in the future.
