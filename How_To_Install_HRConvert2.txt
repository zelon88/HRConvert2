-----MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS-----
HRConvert2 requires at least a Raspberri Pi Model B+ or greater. 
HRConvert2 should run on any x86 or x64 based PC.
HRConvert2 requires a Debian Linux-based operating system w/3rd party audio license.

-----PREFACE-----
For this guide, it is assumed that the user is installing HRConvert2
on a PC which meets the above conditions. This guide will walk
a new user through the installation of HRConvert2 on a freshly installed
version of Lubuntu 16.04 LTS with no pre-existing dependencies. 

For a walkthrough of installing a Ubuntu distro, visit.....
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop

IMPORTANT NOTE: During this guide we will be setting-up a fully
functional, yet somewhat customized, LAMP stack including 
linux, Apache2.4, MySQL, and PHP7.0. If you DO NOT want to have
a LAMP stack installed on your local machine DO NOT install this software.
This software was designed to be run on a dedicated server setup for NAS
duties.

In the abscence of required dependencies, HRConvert2 will make every attempt 
to complete a user-suppied operation while logging errors every step of the way. 
Administrators are responsible for monitoring and maintaining the dependencies 
of their servers.
--------------------------------------------------

-----STEP 1 - INSTALL APACHE 2.4-----
-sudo apt-get update
-sudo apt-get install apache2
-sudo apt-get install curl
--------------------------------------------------

-----STEP 2 - INSTALL PHP7 & PLUGINS-----
-sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
-sudo apt-get install php-all-dev
**YOU MAY NEED TO CHANGE THE VERSIONS BELOW DEPENDING ON YOUR UBUNTU/PHP VERSION**
-sudo apt-get install php7.1-zip (Replace version number with whatever version you want)
-sudo apt-get install php7.1-gd (Replace version number with whatever version you want)
-sudo apt-get install php-curl
**EDIT THE "php.ini" FILE LOCATED IN "/etc/php/7.1/apache2/php.ini"**
-sudo leafpad /etc/php/7.1/apache2/php.ini
**SEARCH FOR AND MODIFY THE FOLLOWING VALUES CAREFULLY**
  max_execution_time = 90
  max_input_time = 90
  memory_limit = 512M
  ;Use 256 - 384M for Raspberry Pis
  display_errors = On
  ;Leave display errors = Off if you're not debugging HRConvert2 youself
  post_max_size = 3000M
  upload_max_filesize = 3000M
  max_file_uploads = 100
  zlib.output_compression = On
**SAVE THE MODIFIED "php.ini" FILE AND EXIT LEAFPAD**
-sudo service apache2 restart
--------------------------------------------------

-----STEP 4 - INSTALL BASIC FEATURE DEPENDENCIES-----
-sudo apt-get install clamav && sudo apt-get install libreoffice-common && sudo apt-get install unoconv
-sudo leafpad /etc/rc.local
**ADD THE FOLLOWING LINE TO THE "rc.local" FILE **ABOVE** THE "exit 0" LINE**
  /usr/bin/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin --headless --accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=$soffice_port;urp;" --nofirststartwizard &
**IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN rc.local FILE, COPY AND PASTE THE INCLUDED ONE**
-sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
-sudo systemctl enable rc-local.service
-sudo apt-get install rar && sudo apt-get install unrar && sudo apt-get install p7zip-full && sudo apt-get install imagemagick && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg && sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr && sudo apt-get install meshlab && sudo apt-get install dia && sudo apt-get install pandoc && sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
**REBOOT THE SERVER**
**IF DOCUMENT CONVERSIONS DONT WORK...**
          **-unoconv --listen**
          **OR -unoconv -l**
          **OR create a daemon to run unoconv --listen**
--------------------------------------------------

-----STEP 5 - INSTALL HRConvert2-----
**CREATE A DIRECTORY IN "/var/www/html" NAMED "HRProprietary"**
**CREATE ANOTHER DIRECTORY IN "/var/www/html/HRProprietary" NAMED "HRConvert2"**
**VISIT "http://github.com/zelon88/HRConvert2" AND DOWNLOAD THE LATEST HRConvert2 .zip FILE
  TO YOUR DOWNLOADS FOLDER**
**EXTRACT HRConvert2.zip TO YOUR DOWNLOADS FOLDER**
**COPY THE CONTENTS OF THE "HRConvert2-master" FOLDER TO "/var/www/html/HRProprietary/HRConvert2"*
-sudo leafpad /var/www/html/HRProprietary/HRConvert2/config.php
**CAREFULLY READ AND COMPLETELY FILL OUT THE CONFIG.PHP FILE!!!**
**HRConvert2 REQUIRES A SAFE LOCATION TO CREATE USER CONVERT DIRECTORIES. TO FACILITATE
  THIS YOU MUST CREATE A !!!NEW!!! DIRECTORY AND ENTER IS AS THE "$ConvertLoc"**
**ONCE YOU HAVE CREATED A CLOUD LOCATION "$ConvertLoc" CONTINUE**
          -sudo chmod -R 0755 /path/to/my/ConvertLoc
          -sudo chown -R www-data /path/to/my/ConvertLoc
          -sudo chgrp -R www-data /path/to/my/ConvertLoc
**IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A VALID "$ConvertLoc" AND PROPER PERMISSIONS, HRConvert2 ...WILL...NOT...WORK!!!**
**CAREFULLY READ AND COMPLETELY FILL OUT YOUR ADMIN USER AND LOGIN INFO FOR HRAI**
-sudo chmod -R 0755 /var/www/html
-sudo chown -R www-data /var/www/html
-sudo chgrp -R www-data /var/www/html
**OPTIONAL -sudo useradd -g www-data USERNAME  #adds your user to www-data usergroup.**
**MAKE SURE THAT ANY UPDATES YOU PERFORM TO HRConvert2 HAVE PROPER PERMISSIONS!!!**
**SCRUTINIZE / DOUBLE-CHECK THE PERMISSIONS FOR ANY FILES ADDED TO /HRConvert2 AFTER 
  INSTALLATION IS COMPLETE!!!**

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you need to correct permissions later, perform the following commands 
  from above again...
               -sudo chmod -R 0755 /var/www/html
               -sudo chown -R www-data /var/www/html
               -sudo chgrp -R www-data /var/www/html
--------------------------------------------------

-----STEP 6 - VISIT YOUR CONVERTER!!!-----
Go to http://localhost/HRProprietary/HRConvert2/convertCore.php to view your Converter! The computer you install HRConvert2 onto
should be considered a staitionary server that you can safely point your "Static NAT" at and access from anywhere. To accomplish
these things, follow the additional steps below. 
--------------------------------------------------

-----STEP 7 - ADD FIREWALL EXCEPTIONS AND SETUP STATIC NAT ON YOUR ROUTER-----
-According to the manual for the manufacturer of your broadband router, find the local IP address where you can make changes to it's
  configuration. Try entering "192.168.1.1" into a browser. If you are greeted with a login screen, check the bottom of your router or your
  system administrator for the required information. If you are not greeted with any tangible login screen other than an error message, 
  seek the owners manual for the specific make and manual for your router.
-Once you have gained access to your router, seek the settings which control Firewall exceptions and Static NAT settings.
  You should seek a way to enter the local IPv4 address of the machine running HRConvert2.
  You should also seek a way to enter a "Static NAT" entry for the local IPv4 address of the machine running HRConvert2.
  You should also forward port 80 to the internal IPv4 of the machine running HRConvert2.
  To configure SSL encryption, add port 443 to your port forwarding rules and visit www.letsencrypt.com for instructions on obtaining and installing an SSL certificate.
-HRConvert2 will create and maintain complete segregation of user files during operation, and will not impose restrictions on user uploads
  (however PHP will, so verify that your php.ini file is set correctly!!!).
-You and your users should now be able to access your server via any standard web browser by entering the IPv4 from your 
  ISP into the address bar. Alternatively you can purchase a domain name and point it at the IPv4 instead to obtain a ".com" 
  (or similar) address for your new installation.
