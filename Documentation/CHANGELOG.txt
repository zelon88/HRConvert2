COMMIT 4/4/2023
v3.2.1 - Continue working on languageStrings concept.

-v3.2.1.
-Work on Arabic language pack.
-Add $GUIAlignment variable to control the float of UI elements.
  -This is needed to make lists presentable in right-to-left languages.
-Add dynamic supported format counting instead of hard-coding the number of formats for each UI.
  -Previously we would count and adjust the number of unique conversions that are supported, then hard code this value into each UI.
  -Now the core counts the number of supported formats and uses this value when building the UI.
  -This is more maintainable, and more accurate.
  -Now each converter will reflect the number of formats that are actually supproted.
  -So if an administrator disables all conversions except for model conversions, there will be a very small number of supported conversions reflected in the UI.

--------------------
COMMIT 3/28/2023
v3.2 - Continue working on languageStrings concept.

-v3.2.
-Implement dynamic supported format list in UI1 (english language pack only).
  -The UI will now only display supported formats that are backed by logic.
  -The lists of supported formats contained within the UI no longer need to be updated.
  -The lists of supported formats are now entirely derived by logic.
  -Still need to add OCR related formats when that refactor takes place.
  -Need to keep going on UI2.
-Added version verification to convertCore.php.
  -The logic is split between verifyInstallation() and verifyGlobals(). 
  -verifyInstallation() verifies versionInfo.php and loads it.
  -verifyGlobals() performs the actual version check.
  -Modified ERROR_DESCRIPTIONS.txt to match these changes.
  -Added ERROR 24000 when unable to load the versionInfo.php file.
-Updated ERROR 11.
  -Added information about the new version check.
-Continue changing double quotes in HTML to single quotes.
  -Header is done.
  -UI1 is done.
  -Footer is done.
-Move paths for scripts, stylesheets, javascript & favicon to verifyGlobals().
-The name of the archive when a user selects to compress all files now reflects $ApplicationName variable.
  -This was previously hard-coded to "HRConvert2_Files-<DATE>".
-Added mysteriously missing bitrate UI features.
-Adjust the list of supported formats to be more reliable, predictible, maintainable.
-Only set FormatArray variables for the SupportedConversionTypes enabled in config.php.
  -Now the arrays aren't even populated unless the conversion type is enabled.
-Move "The user selected..." text to the beginning of the upload and download functions.
-Prevent the upload of unsupported file formats.
-Prevent the download of unsupported file formats.
  -Add ERROR 3004 "Unsupported File Format" to ERROR_DESCRIPTIONS.txt.
  -Copy ERROR 6001.
-Add extra line of detail to error 6001: "The file that causes this error will be skipped."
-OCR operations now require that both OCR and Document conversion types are allowed in config.php.
-Stream conversion operations now require that both Stream and Audio conversion types are allowed in config.php.
-Add a $GUIDirection variable to languageStrings.php that determines the reading order of the UI.
  -Can either be "ltr" for "left to right" or "rtl" for "right to left".
  -A default is defined in verifyGlobals() but this is overridden later by languageStrings.php.
  -This should make migrating old language packs easier.
-Add delete functionality to core logic section & UI.
  -Add ERROR 24, Delete Failed.
-Disable loading spinner on error return in UI2.
  -Before the spinner would remain on error.

--------------------
COMMIT 3/20/2023
v3.1.9.9 - Continue working on languageStrings concept.

-v3.1.9.9.
-Standardize logic format across all UI elements.
  -Header. UI1, UI2, Footer.
  -They all declare that they are loaded and error when the core is not loaded.
  -The rest of the error logic is contained within languageStrings.php.
  -Per language pack, the logic is only contained within the code once. Instead of once for each UI file.
-Start moving UI1 text to languageStrings.php.
-Adjust the format of languageStrings.php.
-Add icon for future delete functionality.
  -https://www.iconarchive.com/show/koloria-icons-by-graphicrating.1.html
-Update subtitle icon.
  -https://www.iconarchive.com/show/koloria-icons-by-graphicrating.1.html

--------------------
COMMIT 3/9/2023
v3.1.9.8 - Clean up core variable assignments. Start working on delete functionality.

-v3.1.9.8.
-Taking a break from languageStrings to work on the core a bit.
  -Need a change of pace.
-Added deleteFiles() function for removing files manually (before they are deleted automatically).
-Preparing for the next round of UI feature updates.
  -Subtitle conversions.
  -Delete files manually.
-Added errors 23000, 23001, 23002.
-Reordered errors so they are sequential in the ERROR_DESCRIPTIONS.txt file.
  -Before they went in logical order as they are written in convertCore.php, which is confusing unless you know the code.

--------------------
COMMIT 3/9/2023
v3.1.9.7 - Continue working on languageStrings concept.

-v3.1.9.7.
-Keep working on english GUI2.
-Make buildGui() function with comprehensive checks to ensure that things are loaded properly.
-This commit will still cause Error 16 because I've only completed one language pack.
  -Hopefully once this is done to all language packs things will be more maintanable.

--------------------
COMMIT 3/9/2023
v3.1.9.6 - Continue working on languageStrings concept.

-v3.1.9.6.
-Development Version.
  -Language packs other than English will not work.
  -English language pack is unreliable.
  -OCR operations need attention.
-I screwed up and posted the last batch of commits (v3.1.9.5) to to the wrong branch! 
  -Then got frustrated and deleted the development branch.
  -Now that I'm not as frustrated I will try again.
-Reduce the amount of HTML tags that goes into languageStrings.php.
  -This is needed because of variable scope. 
  -The file loop in convertGui2.php doesn't update variables contained in languageStrings.php due to where it is called in.
-Start converting the UI HTML to single quotes wherever possible.

--------------------
COMMIT 3/7/2023
v3.1.9.5 - Continue working on languageStrings concept.

-v3.1.9.5.
-Added an official Development branch to the official repo.
  -The reason for this is because I'd like to stage updates on the Development branch until they are ready.
  -Then the master branch will get updated only to stable versions.
  -This is required because it has been taking me several commits to fully implement several features/fixes/improvements.
  -I always try to have an error free program at commit time, but still; new users should not be exposed to an incomplete versions.
-Shortened verifyGlobals() in convertCore.php by assigning multiple variables of the same value at the same time.
-Add alt and title text to english language pack, download button.
  -Will continue adding the rest.
-Updated CREATING_LANGUAGE_PACKS.txt file.
  -Expanded on --About Language Packs-- section.
  -Added --Maintaining Language Packs-- section, in case anyone else out there gets super ambitious ;)
  -Added --Development Tips-- section.
  -Added info about languageStrings.php file.
  -Revised the wording for the rest of the files.
-Add array check in verifyLanguage() function to $SupportedLanguages array.
-Fix bug in verifyLanguage.php caused by misplaced bracket (with matching bad indentation). 
  -Would have caused problems during reverting to default language if $AllowUserSelectableLanguage was set to FALSE.

--------------------
COMMIT 3/6/2023
v3.1.9.4 - Work on languageStrings concept - separate language specific UI & logic from base UI elements.

-v3.1.9.4.
-The goal of moving the language specific text and logic from the base UI elements is that it becomes easier to maintain language packs.
  -Currently every time I release an update that modifies a language pack, I must duplicate that update 14 times and change relevant language related text.
  -By separating this and itemizing it in variables contained in a new languageStrings.php file, maintaining things and adding features becomes easier.
  -Also, the base files header, convertGui1, convertGui2, and footer become universal. Meaning that changes to them can be easily duplicated.
  -We could simply get rid of these from the language packs and simplify a language pack down to just the languageStrings file.
  -We can explore that later.
-Update english language pack, working on formatting new style for all language packs.
  -Move all language related logic to new languageStrings.php file.
-Improve ERROR 16 description in ERROR_DESCRIPTIONS.txt.
-Make verifyLanguage function more robust.
  -Add detection for if the root Language folder exists.
  -Utilize global variables for required directory detection.
-Add global variables to contain language pack file paths.

-v3.1.9.2.
-Work on es, fr, hi language packs.
-Keep numbering language packs to v3.1.9.1.
-Update language pack update procedure.
-Add "languageStrings.php" file to english language pack as a placeholder.
  -Will eventually migrate all locale specific text strings and direct formatting to this file.
  -With all strings separated from the UI it will be easier to maintain the UI.
  -We could keep separate h,1,2,f files or keep a master set and only load the languageStrings file.
  -If we keep separate people can modify their language easier. Also makes lh/rh reading order easier.
  -If we use a master set we reduce size and complexity.

--------------------
COMMIT 2/21/2023
v3.1.9.1 - Continue updating language packs.

v2.8.7 - Added User Virus Scanning support, download button, loading spinner options & more.

-v2.8.7.
-Fixed an undefined variable warning in the virusScan() function.
-Cleaned up memory deallocation routine in the virusScan() function.
-Only enable file related operations if valid tokens have been supplied.
-Improved sanitization integrity.
-Combined the functionality of HRScan2 into HRConvert2.
  -Now users can select to scan uploaded files for viruses on-demand using ClamAV or zelon88/ScanCore.
  -The codebases for both are "sisters" so maintainence has always been a pain.
  -Whenever one gets updated a lot of the code needed to be modified and merged into the other one.
  -Considering the major refactor that just took place with HRConvert2 (which took almmost 38 caffene fueled hours) I figure we would merge functionality instead of refactoring another core.
  -These features can be disabled via config.php.
  -Some administrators won't want users uploading potentially malicious files, which makes sense.
  -If $UserVirusScanning is enabled in config.php the HRScan2 features will be savailable.
  -If $UserVirusScanning is not enabled in config.php the HRScan2 features will be unavailable.
  -This behaviour change requires some changes to the way regular virus scanning is performed.
  -If $UserVirusScanning is enabled we must disable regular virus scanning during the file upload phase.
  -Note that all other regular virus scan operations are still enforced.
  -Meaning that if a user uploads a file that is infected, they will still NOT be allowed to perform download, conversion, archive, or OCR operations on them.
  -They WILL be allowed to scan the file using User Virus Scan options.
  -Also if a normal virus scan detects a malicious file while $AllowUserVirusScan is enabled, the file WILL NOT be immediately deleted.
  -It will be allowed to remain until regular cleanup activities remove it (after the $DeleteThreshold has passed).
-Added color specific down arrow buttons to the GUI.
-Added Download File button to convertGui2.php page.
  -Now you can redownload any file in the HRConvert2 scratch space.
-Added Scan File & Scan All buttons to convertGui2.php page.
-Added config entry for adjusting the backround color of the GUI.
-Added config entry for adjusting the loading spinner style.
-Added 6 spinners for each color scheme (24 spinners total).
-Can now specify your own spinner in config.php.
-Refactored convertGui2.php file for English & Arabic so far.
  -Need to continue doing the rest.
  -Only English & Arabic language packs have support for the new API features related to User Virus Scans.
-Updated ERROR_DESCIPTIONS.txt with the latest errors related to virus scanning.

  -Cleaned up the comment intro section to all PHP files to have the same basic formatting & structure.
  -Polish the README some more.
  -Make logs respect the $ApplicationName variable as soon as it becomes available.
    -No more hardcoded "HRConvert2" in log entries.
  -Moved styleCore.php to Resources directory, since it only contains 4 front-end related variables and no logic of its own.
  -The goal is to cleanup the root of the repo to make it more presentable & approacable for newbies.
    -All the important files related to logic are in the root of the repo.
    -Makes the repo more modular as well.
-Make $_GET['language'] codes language case-insensitive.
-Log files are now named after the $ApplicationName variable set in config.php rather than using HRConvert2 in the filename.
-Reordered some logic.
-Disable GUI compilation when responding to a file operation request.
  -The front end doesn't use output from the core anyway.
  -This clears the way to enable such functionality by controlling the when GUI elements are actually needed.
-No longer throws 404 errors when a file conversion fails.
-No longer opens compatible files in the browser but starts a download instead.
-No more HTML undefined errors when requesitng a download.

--------------------
COMMIT - 4/14/2022
v2.8 - Major convertCore.php refactor. Complete modular redesign. Same functionality, same look, more predictable & consistent. Easier to maintain.

-v2.8.
-Refactor the core.
  -The original codebase was developed more than 4 years ago.
    -The first unpublished experiments began in 2014.
  -The "generation" of the HRConvert2 codebase until today was "Valkyrie".
    -HonestRepair server side software comes in 3 generations. 
    -The first generation is unsafe to use. It is part of the "zelon88/HRToolkitTools" repo.
      -It was called the "Genesis" engine because it was a proof-of-concept design.
      -Hence the name "Genesis".
    -The second generation is performant & safe to use but hard to maintain.
      -It is called the "Valkyrie" engine because the runtime environment is "dynamically constructed".
      -The "Valkyrie" in Norse mythology is any of a group of maidens who serves the god Odin.
      -Valkyrie's were also the "Choosers of the slain" and decided who would die on the battlefield.
      -Because the "Valkyrie" codebase is made up of one main core served by smaller cores that dynamically call dependencies.
      -Hence the name "Valkyrie" is very fitting.
    -The third and current generation is called "Diablo". It is secure, performant, & modular.
      -"Diablo" is Spanish for Devil. 
      -The coding convention was introduced in the "Zelon88/HRCloud3" alpha repo and is currently under active development. 
      -If you're a major Cloud provider you should fear Diablo.
  -Removes most core output except from log files or when logs cannot be reached.
  -Uses a more consistent logging/error catching mechanism.
  -Makes the core extremely modular and easy to work on.
  -Adding new features is easier because logging and error functions are repeatable & consistent.
  -Output is consistent.
  -Logic flow is capable of withstanding non-fatal errors.
    -Before we stopped execution for a lot more things.
    -Logic behavior is more intuitive.
  -Errors produced use incremental error numbers that can be easily adjusted or documented.
  -Log generation happens earlier during execution, meaning more logs can be captured.
    -More logs means problems are easier to identify & debug.
  -Switching to a modern design will mean more interoperability of functions between applications.
    -It becomes easier to apply simiilar patches to other products.
  -I don't have to look at my old code anymore.
    -Programmers grow. Programming styles change. 
    -I am a better programmer now than I was when I first wrote this.
    -There will probably be bugs introduced and regressions but at least I'll enjoy working on the codebase again.
    -This work needed to get done eventually anyway considering it will be needed for HRCloud3.
-Added $Verbose config entry for controlling the amount of logging performed.
  -If $Verbose is set to TRUE every significant operation will create a log entry.
  -If $Verbose is set to FALSE only errors will create a log entry.
-$VirusScan config entry now only accepts boolean values.
-Improve formatting of config.php file for readability.
-All conversions except archive conversions now receive 5 conversion attempts.
  -Previously it was only for documents and the threshold was 10 attempts.
-Reworked the way the document conversion engine is started and verified.
-Removed a lot of unused variables.
-Started using the same capitalization scheme as HRCloud3 (Diablo style).
  -Lower case first letter variables denote highly limited scope.
  -Upper case first letter variables denote very wide (almost global) scope.
  -I know that PHP takes care of memory cleanup, and I know how variable scope works in functions.
    -I also don't care. 
    -Doing the capitalization scheme and manually NULL'ing + unsetting variables helps me keep track of variables.
    -I came up with this scheme exactly because I kept seeing dead variables in my code and I wanted it to stop.
    -This forces accountability for all variables and puts visiblity on most of them.
    -So when one of them isn't used anywhere it kind of stands out.
-Refactored Javascript a tiny bit.
-Now the core will remember when you leave and come back for a short while.
-Added unique identifier for logs. 
  -Makes searching logs much easier because requests group together.
-Core now captures the stdout of it's dependencies.
  -Writes to log if $Verbose is set to TRUE.
-Changed extraction behaviour for archive conversions.
  -Archive conversions where the destination folder already exists will have the new contents ADDED to the original archive instead of replacing them.
  -You can now build archives in this fashion, admittedly it is not for the faint of heart.
-Remove sanitizeCore.php.
  -This has been replaced by the verifyGlobals() function in convertCore.php.
  -This was a suggestion made about 5 years ago on Reddit. It finally happened!
-I worked on this commit for 30 hours straight with no sleep.
  -With only one consecutive 90 minute break to take a phone call.
  -Then I took a 3 hour nap and finished the rest, over the next 8 hours.
  -I am recovering from a broken leg and surgery to fix it and I still have a couple more weeks to go.
  -Send halp!
